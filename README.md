# YearPredictionMSD-Machine-Learning
This is the final project of the course "Python for Data Analysis".

Our data set is the YearPredictionMSD Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This data set is composed of 515 345 songs released between 1922 and 2011. These songs are mostly western, commercial tracks. There are 91 variables, the first variable is the release year, ranging from 1922 to 2011. The 12 following variables are timbre averages, and the 78 last variables are timbre covariances. They take real values.

We wish to predict the release year of a given song, from 90 of its audio features (the 12 timbre averages and the 78 timbre covariances).
Therefore, the target variable is the release year, and the features are the 12 timbre averages and the 78 timbre covariances.

For further explanation, see the pdf of the PowerPoint that is in this repository.
